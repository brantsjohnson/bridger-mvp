## MBTI Personality System

The system now calculates MBTI types based on:
- **Extraversion (E/I)**: Social behavior and energy direction
- **Openness (N/S)**: Information processing and creativity
- **Agreeableness (F/T)**: Decision-making and values
- **Conscientiousness (J/P)**: Organization and planning

## Fallback

If a video file is missing, the system will show an error message but allow the user to continue with just the text description and one-liner.
